     <h2>My life</h2> <!-- This is a heading -->
     <p>I am Harry Mootz a 19 year old student currently studying at the University of Northampton doing a Computing (web technology and security) course. I was born in Chertsey, Surrey but have lived the majority of my life in a small village next to the Malvern Hills (see landing page cover). I have always had an interest in IT and computing since I first used a computer in primary school, which is why I went down that particular route for sixth form. It is my dream one day to get a job in the security where I will be able to travel around and see different places through my work.</p>
     <p>In my spare time I enjoy walking the Malvern Hills, fell-walking in the Lake District and badminton. I have undertaken voluntary work at a local nature reserve (Ravenshill Woodland reserve) and worked as a volunteer for a Bushcraft School, including shelter building, providing fresh water, washing up, firewood collection and food preparation. I also got into orienteering a few years ago through scouts and i was particularly pleased to achieve the following : Harlequins Orienteering Club Malvern mini league boys winner.
            </p>
     <h2>My aspirations</h2>
    <p>After completing the course I would like to become an independent consultant working as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, qualified with CISSP. I think this would be a very stimulating job, also the idea of successfully protecting companies from cyber-attacks sounds very appealing
