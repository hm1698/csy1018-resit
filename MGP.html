<h1>Good Practice in web design</h1>

    <p1>It was of the upmost importance that my website is easily useable and accessible. Therefore from the very beginning i.e. the planning stage of the website, me and my group discussed how we could implement code into the software to allow the website to be highly usable. Through looking at other websites such as these portfolio pages we gathered ideas on how to do this. I particularly liked the navigation used of this website  I found it very simple but also very professional looking, so I made sure I added in a similar design but changed it to make it  unique. I understood that the majority of web users these days are accessing the internet from a tablet or mobile device, therefore it has to be accessible on these devices otherwise I could risk losing a lot of viewers from my website. So flexboxes were implemented in the CSS to stop margins from collapsing when screen is made smaller via mobile devices; it also causes the website to be more responsive so I added it on several pages. </p>

                <p>When designing the navigation of the website I wanted to make it as clear as possible so I implemented some code causing the word hovered on with the mouse to change colour (I chose red as it stands out best from the blue navigation bar) and increase in size. This will make this site more useable for people with disadvantaged eyesight. I made sure that the colour scheme I went for, blue and cream, as they are harmonious colours as they look good together and they are also easy to tell apart. I went for simplicity as too many colours would cause strain on the viewers eyes.</p>
