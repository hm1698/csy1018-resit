        <p>I have always had an interest in IT and computing since I first used a computer in primary school, which is why I went down that particular route for sixth form. My main subject choices at sixth form were ICT and Creative media which were both heavily computer based which makes me very familiar with using a desktop computer. Not only did the ICT course provide a sound foundation for my chosen university course, but also many of the individual course modules were particularly applicable. I have gained further insight into computer based jobs from the work experiences I have undertaken at Malvern Instruments and EDF Energy (Gloucester). Whilst completing the experience I worked to the highest level on the criteria. This inspired me even more to complete further education in order to allow me to get an interesting and well remunerated job in the information security market. So I am currently doing a Web Technology and Security course at the University of Northampton.

        <p>After completing my course at the University of Northampton I would like to become an independent consultant working as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, qualified with CISSP. I think this would be a very stimulating job, also the idea of successfully protecting companies from cyber-attacks sounds very appealing. During my work experience it was very clear how important cyber security is to all businesses, large and small. It was this that first sparked my interest in completing an information security course at university and then going on to work in the industry.</p>
